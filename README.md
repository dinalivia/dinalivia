### Hi there, I'm Dina ðŸ‘‹

I am an analytical and empathetic backend engineer with a natural leadership mindset, excelling as both a team player and an independent contributor.

Iâ€™m passionate about fostering high standards and challenging the status quo to drive continuous improvement and long-term success. A strong advocate for best practices, I thrive on building scalable, high-quality solutions while promoting collaboration through clear communication and approachability. I'm known for my critical thinking, problem-solving skills, and ability to inspire and unite teamsâ€”even in non-leadership roles.

Iâ€™m also part of Cumbuca Dev â€” a community-driven initiative that empowers underrepresented groups through open source, career programs, and technical consulting. Weâ€™re passionate about strengthening the open source ecosystem in Brazil while creating inclusive spaces for more people to thrive in tech.

People > Tech ðŸ’œ

Bonus: I'm a dedicated cat lover who believes a bit of feline inspiration can make any team purr with success.
